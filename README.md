# Linear-Regression-Analysis_E-commerce-Store-Data-Analysis

# Background
This is an e-commerce analysis for a store which offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The business is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

# Objective
With the use of linear regression, the anaylsis aims to help the business determine which of the two channels are generating more revenue.
